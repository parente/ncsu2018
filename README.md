## [Project Jupyter: Open Tools for Human-in-the-Loop Computing](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/events/open-tools-for-human-in-the-loop-computing)

Project Jupyter is a collaborative effort to create open source software and open standards for interactive computing and data analysis. From [executing textbook examples](https://speakerdeck.com/fperez/keynote-for-jupytercon-2017-in-nyc?slide=26) for university students,  to visualizing the behavior of financial algorithms in a [cloud backtesting service](https://www.quantopian.com/notebooks/survey) to publishing reproducible analyses of [groundbreaking science](https://blog.jupyter.org/congratulations-to-the-ligo-and-virgo-collaborations-from-project-jupyter-5923247be019), Jupyter impacts the daily work of people across disciplines.

In this talk, I will outline the motivation and history of the project, give live demonstrations of key Jupyter components (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, nbviewer, JupyterLab), highlight some exciting use cases in the broader Jupyter community, and help you get started with Jupyter in your own work.
